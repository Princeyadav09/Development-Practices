Load Balancer : 
Imagine you have a favorite restaurant thatâ€™s always packed with hungry customers. Now, this place has only one chef, and as much as they love cooking, itâ€™s tough for them to handle all the orders alone. As a result, some customers end up waiting forever for their food, while others get served quickly.
Load balancing is like having a team of chefs in the kitchen. When the restaurant gets busy, the orders are evenly distributed among the chefs. This way, each chef can focus on a manageable number of orders, ensuring that everyone gets their food promptly.


Network Load balancer (layer 4 transport layer):
Layer 4 Load Balancer operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model. It makes decisions based on information such as the source and destination IP addresses, as well as the port numbers of incoming requests. The main focus of Layer 4 load balancers is to distribute network traffic efficiently across multiple servers.
ðŸ”‘ How it works:
When a user sends a request to access a website or application, the Layer 4 Load Balancer receives the request. It then looks at the transport layer data (IP addresses and ports) to determine which server should handle the request. The load balancer uses various algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections) to decide the best server to forward the request to. This ensures that traffic is evenly spread among the servers, improving performance and avoiding overloading any single server.
Application Load Balancer (Load Balancer 7):
Layer 7 Load Balancer operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model. It can make more intelligent decisions based on application-specific data, such as HTTP headers, cookies, and URLs. Layer 7 Load Balancers understand application protocols, enabling them to optimize traffic distribution for specific applications or services.
ðŸ”‘ How it works:
When a user sends a request, the Layer 7 Load Balancer analyzes the content of the request to gain insights into the application being accessed. For example, it can identify the type of service (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) or the specific URL being requested. Using this information, the load balancer can make intelligent decisions about which server is best suited to handle the request. This allows for more advanced load balancing strategies, such as sending certain requests to specialized servers that can handle specific application tasks.
