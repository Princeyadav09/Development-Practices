In SQL, NULL represents the absence of a value or an unknown value. It is not a specific value like 0 or an empty string ''. Because NULL represents the absence of a value, it behaves differently from other values in SQL comparisons.

Here's why databases treat NULL as a special case:

Three-valued logic: SQL uses a three-valued logic system: TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN. When comparing a value to NULL, the result is UNKNOWN. This is because NULL represents an unknown value, so the result of any comparison involving NULL is neither true nor false, but rather unknown.

Unknown comparison: When you use WHERE field = NULL, the result is not TRUE or FALSE, but UNKNOWN. So, the rows where the field is NULL are not returned, because SQL treats the comparison as WHERE UNKNOWN, which does not meet the condition of returning rows where field equals NULL.

To test for NULL values in SQL, you should use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL instead of the equality operator (=). For example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM table WHERE field IS NULL;
This query will correctly return rows where the field is NULL. Similarly, you can use IS NOT NULL to find rows where the field is not NULL.
