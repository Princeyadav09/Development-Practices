Rebasing:

Updates the base of a branch by moving its commits onto another branch.
Essentially replays your changes on top of the latest changes from another branch.
Helps keep your branch up-to-date with changes happening in another branch, such as main.
Results in a linear history, making it easier to understand and review changes.
Should be used with caution if your branch has already been shared, as it can rewrite history and potentially cause conflicts for collaborators.
In short, rebasing helps incorporate the latest changes from one branch into another while maintaining a clean and organized commit history.
